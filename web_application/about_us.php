            <p> We, from Workout Pal, are four students of the university of Amsterdam.
              It all started when we were assigned to create a website which would help the
              world. We worked hard, thought deeply and built the website as it is known
              today. If you'd asked us back then, we never imagined it would be such a success.
              It's just like exercising: if you are in good company, you can work harder. If you
              work harder, you make more miles. And if you make more miles, you can reach your
              goals.
