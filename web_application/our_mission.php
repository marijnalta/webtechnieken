            <h2><font color=#2ecc71>Mission,</font> Vision &#38; Values</h2>
            <p> Health is one of the Sustainable Development Goals, created by the United Nations.
                One of the biggest health problems in our society is obesity. Our mission is to tackle
                this problem in a fun and effective way by bringing people together. We introduce different
                users with each other who otherwise never would have met. We think people lack training partners in their social circles. Your own friends could be far above or beneath your fitness level. This way users meet new people who are equally advanced.
                This makes exercising a more positive experience. The users will exercise more and more. And this way the positive circle continues!</p>
